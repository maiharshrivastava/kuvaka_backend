## üí° **About the Project**

This project demonstrates a **real-time chat application** that allows users to join chat rooms, send messages, and interact with others in the same room. It utilizes **Node.js** for the backend, **Socket.IO** for real-time communication, and **ReactJS** for the frontend.

The project is organized into two main parts:

- **Frontend (client/)**: A ReactJS-based user interface.
- **Backend (server/)**: A Node.js server using Socket.IO for handling real-time communication.
